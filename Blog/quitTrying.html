                <h2>Quit Trying</h2>
                <p class="blog-date">October 06, 2025 · Life</p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">In a world full of people asking you to never stop trying, today I am urging you to quit.
                     There are few words in the world that are more telling of the fact that you will not succeed than “I am trying.”
                       I was sitting in class this week and overheard a college-aged girl lean over and tell a friend, “I am trying to stop watching TikTok.”
                        All I could do was laugh to myself as I thought of how this girl would probably be watching TikTok 15 minutes into the class.
                         The problem isn’t attempting new goals, it’s how you frame them to yourself.</p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">When you say, “I am trying,” you give yourself an out.
                     You give yourself a way to say, “well I didn’t fail, I was only trying.”
                      Next time you are particularly motivated to obtain a goal, say losing weight, tell your friend, “I am losing weight.”
                       This might not be true at the time, but internally, your mind will change your identity from someone who is trying to lose weight, to someone who is actively losing weight.
                        The difference is in self-identity and the inevitability of the statement that you feel inside.
                         As James Clear writes in Atomic Habits, “The goal is not to read a book — the goal is to become a reader.”
                          It is this shift in identity that an individual should be seeking </p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">By swapping “I’m trying” for an identity, you begin to intrinsically believe that you have already achieved the goal.
                     Each action you take casts a vote for the identity you identified in your goal.
                      For me, when I was training for my first marathon, it started out as me telling myself, “I am going to run a marathon before I graduate high school,” 1 vote.
                       Although still not an identity shifting goal, note that I did not say, “I am going to try to run a marathon.”
                        Then, I signed up for the marathon, 2 votes. In the months leading up to the race, I told my closest friends and family, and the word spread throughout the entire school.
                         Here was the largest impact that the goal had on me, after telling all of these people I would run a marathon, I would have crawled over the finish line if necessary.
                          This is the effect that an intrinsic change in your identity and shaping of your goals can have on you and your ability to reach them.</p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">Saying “I’m trying” is your permission to yourself and others to fail.
                     An identity changing goal is your promise to persist regardless of setbacks.
                      It is this key distinction that I believe has a major impact on your ability to achieve your goals.
                       Vote for the identity you chose each and every day and I promise the results will follow.</p>
