                <h2>Everyone Should Run a Marathon</h2>
                <p class="blog-date">July 20, 2025 Â· Running</p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">The human body, mind, and spirit are capable of great accomplishments.
                     However, the human body also is naturally programmed to always seek the path of least resistance.
                      Thus, there is a STATISTIC of people who say they have not accomplished their largest goals.
                    When an individual puts their head down and accomplishes one large goal, it can open up a flood of goals to be accomplished as a result of the confidence gained.
                </p>
                    <p class="blog-excerpt">Running a marathon does not have to be the major goal that is cracked first, but for many people, running a marathon seems so far fetched and impossible.
                         If a goal feels possible before you act, it is likely that the goal is not lofty enough.
                          Now, if running a marathon does not interest you at all, you will not put the work in to complete it and get the most out of it.</p>
